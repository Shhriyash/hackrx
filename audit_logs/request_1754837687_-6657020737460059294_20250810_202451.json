      "The document provides a step-by-step guide to determine the flight number, but it does not directly state what the flight number is. To find the flight number, one must follow the instructions under '🚦 Step-by-Step Guide'. First, 'Call this endpoint to get the city name: GET https://register.hackrx.in/submissions/myFavouriteCity'. Second, 'Look at the city returned from the API response. Use Sachin's travel notes above to map the city to its landmark'. Third, based on the landmark, 'Choose Your Flight Path' by calling one of the specified GET endpoints. For example, 'If landmark belonging to favourite city is \"Gateway of India\", call: GET https://register.hackrx.in/teams/public/flights/getFirstCityFlightNumber'. The 'Final Deliverable' is to 'Return the correct flight number based on your answer'. Therefore, the exact flight number cannot be determined from the provided static text alone; it requires interactive API calls."
